In this dissertation we proposed a framework for designing splitting criteria for handling multi-valued nominal attributes. Criteria derived from our framework can be implemented to run in polynomial time in $n$ and $k$, with theoretical guarantee of producing a split that is close to the optimal one. This is the only known criteria that have all these characteristics simultaneously.

Experiments over 11 datasets suggest that the GL$\chi^2$ criterion, obtained from our framework, is competitive with the well-established Twoing criterion in terms of both accuracy and speed for datasets with a small number of classes ($k \leq 7$). It is also much faster than Twoing when the number of classes is greater than 10, while keeping a comparable accuracy. Even though the PC-ext criterion does not have a theoretical guarantee, the experiments also show that it has some advantage in terms of accuracy and speed over the other methods, except when used in the conditional inference tree framework. This suggests that PC-ext is very good in terms of comparing different attributes among themselves, but not as good in finding the best split for a given attribute. In these bias-free experiments, the GL$\chi^2$ criterion had the best results.
 
Therefore, our methods are an interesting alternative to deal with datasets with a large number of classes that contain nominal attributes with a large number of different values, since those cannot be properly handled by Twoing due to its exponential running time dependence on the number of classes. In practice, one should also consider using PC-ext and comparing their results in a cross-validation.

Furthermore, our experiments also reinforce the potential of  aggregating attributes as a tool for improving the accuracy of decision trees. An interesting topic for  future research is evaluating the behavior of our criteria in boosted tree methods.
Another direction for future work is developing new methods for automatic aggregating attributes, or improving the available ones.
